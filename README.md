# Express.js Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling when interacting with databases or external resources.  The `/users/:id` route attempts to fetch user data but fails to gracefully handle potential errors, returning unhelpful messages to the client.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.  (Assume a simple database interaction library is already included.)
3. Start the server: `node bug.js`
4. Send a request to `/users/invalidId` or trigger a database error. Observe the unhelpful error response.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with `bugSolution.js` to see improved error handling.

## Bug Fix
The solution involves using proper error handling techniques such as try...catch blocks (for async/await) or consistent error checks within callback functions.  The improved response also includes more informative status codes.
